Answers to machine-learning books. All type-setted using GNU TeXmacs.

For each chapter, I also tried to group exercises into categories.

Books that I want to include:
- [ ] Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (working on it)
- [ ] Mathematics for Machine Learning
- [ ] Elements of Information Theory
