## Chapter 6: Frequentist statistcs

In my opinion, this chapter is not very clearly written, probably because the author tried to be succinct.

The chapter begins by talking about the definition of the sampling distribution of estimators, and two ways to approximate it: bootstrap and large-sample theory. 
However, I find the word "approximate" disturbing. First, these estimated sampling distributions would not be centered at the true parameter value, and
could in fact be quite far away. Because of this (which leads to my second point), the sampling disributions are usually used to measure spread of the true 
sampling distribution - this and its applications (e.g., the derivation of CI) are not mentioned.

In short, this chapter only defines the sampling distribution without going deeper into it.

I think that Section 6.3 and 6.4 are most useful
